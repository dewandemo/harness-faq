No. Your build infrastructure can be configured to use whichever tools you like. For example, Harness Cloud build infrastructure includes pre-installed versions of xcode and other tools, and you can install other tools or versions of tools that you prefer to use. For more information, go to the [CI macOS and iOS development guide](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/development-guides/ci-ios).
