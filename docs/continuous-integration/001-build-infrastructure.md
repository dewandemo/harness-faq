<!-- ## What is build infrastructure and why do I need it for Harness CI? -->

A build stage's infrastructure definition, the _build infrastructure_, defines "where" your stage runs. It can be a Kubernetes cluster, a VM, or even your own local machine. While individual steps can run in their own containers, your stage itself requires a build infrastructure to define a common workspace for the entire stage. For more information about build infrastructure and CI pipeline components go to:
