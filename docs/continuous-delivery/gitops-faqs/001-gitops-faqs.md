<!-- ## What is Harness GitOps? -->

Harness GitOps lets you perform GitOps deployments in Harness. You define the desired state of the service you want to deploy in your Git manifest, and then use Harness GitOps to sync the state with your live Kubernetes cluster. For more details please see [here](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/gitops/get-started/harness-git-ops-basics/).
