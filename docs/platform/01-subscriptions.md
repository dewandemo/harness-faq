# Harness Subscriptions

### DevOps Essentials

#### What is included in DevOps Essentials?  
The package includes CI, CD, Code Repository, Security Test Orchestration, and Infrastructure as Code Management.   
        
#### Can I scale beyond the included usage metrics?  
Additional pipeline executions, cloud credits, and extended data retention canâ€™t be purchased as add-ons now. At the end of the month, you will receive a bill for overage. The Harness platform does not prevent the overuse of consumption metrics. 

#### What kind of customer support is available? 
Customers receive standard support. They can purchase professional services as an add on.

#### Can DevOps Essentials be deployed on-premises?  
No on-premise support.

#### Do I get more consumption quota based on the number of users I purchase?   
The User quantities do not affect the amount of consumption credits a customer gets. Think about this as the platform fee, and we want to encourage usage regardless of users.

#### Can I buy other Harness Modules in the enterprise and add them to my DevOps Essential Package?   
No, the package is designed for a specific set of use cases. If your business needs those capabilities, please look at our Enterprise offering.

#### Can we integrate DevOps Essentials with our existing tools?  
Yes, DevOps Essentials supports integrations with popular tools such as monitoring services (Datadog, New Relic), ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow), and collaboration platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams).

#### Does Harness support multi-cloud environments?  
DevOps Essentials supports deployments across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, On-Premise Infrastructures, and private cloud setups

#### What integrations are supported out of the box? 
All Harness subscription tiers integrate with popular tools such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, and Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

#### How are updates and new features managed?  
Harness continuously updates DevOps Essentials and Enterprise Modules by adding new features and improvements. Customers receive updates automatically as part of their subscription.

#### What is a user?  
A User is an individual who has been granted direct access to the Harness platform. They can log in, perform actions in the product, and have an email address associated with Harness.

#### Who qualifies for the Corporate Plan?  
- Companies that employ less than or equal to 3000 employees   
- Companies that have less than or equal to 500 developers

### Developer 360

#### For Developer 360 subscriptions, how do we remove users who left the company?

Delete the user(s) from the platform. The user will be removed from the Developer license count immediately.
